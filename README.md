# Consulting-Simulation
Acted within a team of consultants to review and enhance the application process for Postdocs at UGA
After completing multiple interviews with UGA faculty, we created and transformed an “as-is” BPMN diagram into a “to-be” diagram that reflected our suggested improvements of the process
Presented our conclusions to the VP of IT at UGA in lecture and through meetings with the business officers
